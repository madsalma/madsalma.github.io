				<span id="admittance_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The admittance matrix encodes the network topology and electrical parameters of a power system in order to relate the current injection and voltage phasors. Since admittance matrices are central to many power engineering analyses, their characteristics are important subjects of theoretical studies. This paper focuses on the key characteristic of <i>invertibility</i>. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.

				<span id="robustACOPFconvexrestriction_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Electric power grids regularly experience uncertain fluctuations from load demands and renewables, which poses a risk of violating operational limits designed to safeguard the system. In this paper, we consider the robust AC OPF problem that minimizes the generation cost while requiring a certain level of system security in the presence of uncertainty. The robust AC OPF problem requires that the system satisfy operational limits for all uncertainty realizations within a specified uncertainty set. Guaranteeing robustness is particularly challenging due to the non-convex, nonlinear AC power flow equations, which may not always have a solution. In this work, we extend a previously developed convex restriction to a <i>robust convex restriction</i>, which is a convex inner approximation of the non-convex feasible region of the AC OPF problem that accounts for uncertainty in the power injections. We then use the robust convex restriction in an algorithm that obtains robust solutions to AC OPF problems by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. We demonstrate our algorithm and its ability to control robustness versus operating cost trade-offs using PGLib test cases.

				<span id="robust_dc_network_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					With high penetrations of renewable generation and variable loads, there is significant uncertainty associated with power flows in DC networks such that stability and constraint satisfaction are important concerns. Most existing DC network optimal power flow (DN-OPF) formulations assume exact knowledge about loading conditions and do not provide stability guarantees. In contrast, this paper studies a DN-OPF formulation which considers both stability and constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this paper’s robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally amenable problem whose solution provides a feasible operating point for the SIP. This algorithm constructs a convex stability set using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Solving an optimization problem based on this convex stability set provides generator set points which ensure that the DC network has a stable operating point for any considered uncertainty realization. This optimization problem takes a form similar to a deterministic DN-OPF problem and is therefore tractable. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using various DC networks adapted from IEEE test cases.

				<span id="verifying_opt_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					We propose an approach for verifying that a given feasible point for a polynomial optimization problem is globally optimal. The approach relies on the Lasserre hierarchy and the result of Lasserre regarding the importance of the convexity of the feasible set as opposed to that of the individual constraints. By focusing solely on certifying global optimality and relaxing the Lasserre hierarchy using necessary conditions for positive semidefiniteness based on matrix determinants, the proposed method is implementable as a computationally tractable linear program. We demonstrate this method via application to the optimal power flow problem used to operate electric power systems.

						This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for real-time, network-admissible coordination of responsive grid resources aggregated into virtual batteries (VBs).

						Renewable portfolio standards are targeting high levels of variable solar photovoltaics (PV) in electric distribution systems, which makes reliability more challenging to maintain for distribution system operators (DSOs). Distributed energy resources (DERs), including smart, connected appliances and PV inverters, represent responsive grid resources that can provide flexibility to support the DSO in actively managing their networks to facilitate reliability under extreme levels of solar PV. This flexibility can also be used to optimize system operations with respect to economic signals from wholesale energy and ancillary service markets. Here, we present a novel hierarchical scheme that actively controls behind-the-meter DERs to reliably manage each unbalanced distribution feeder and exploits the available flexibility to ensure reliable operation and economically optimizes the entire distribution network. Each layer of the scheme employs advanced optimization methods at different timescales to ensure that the system operates within both grid and device limits. The hierarchy is validated in a large-scale realistic simulation based on data from the industry. Simulation results show that coordination of flexibility improves both system reliability and economics, and enables greater penetration of solar PV. Discussion is also provided on the practical viability of the required communications and controls to implement the presented scheme within a large DSO.

					<span id="twprs_MAK1_2020" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Using distributed energy resources (DERs), such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems (ESSs) as a way to manage demand has been known for decades. A demand management scheme that explicitly considers the individual DER's local quality of service (QoS) is known as demand dispatch. Packetized energy management (PEM) is a demand dispatch paradigm that borrows packet-based concepts from wireless communications to dynamically manage fleets of DER at-scale and in realtime via small, discrete fixed-duration/fixed-power energy packets. PEM addresses QoS in a bottom-up fashion by having a coordinator authorize/deny incoming requests from DERs to consume energy packets. This manuscript extends prior work on modeling a large-scale population (i.e., macro-model) of homogeneous TCLs and ESSs operating under the PEM paradigm. In particular, we extend the macro-model methodology to include deferrable loads (DLs), such as EVs, together with analysis of QoS guarantees. Comparisons between an agent-based (micro-model) simulation and the proposed macro-model are presented to validate modeling accuracy and QoS guarantees.

						This manuscript presents design and analysis of a set of reference-tracking control policies for large-scale coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) and quantifies tracking errors that arise due to heterogeneity in the power ratings for a fleet of DERs. In particular, the relay-based, reference-tracking control strategy that underpins much of packetized energy management (PEM) is augmented to uniquely leverage PEM's energy packet request mechanism to optimize the number of accepted requests and to explicitly consider the quality of service (QoS). In addition, tracking errors from modeling a heterogeneous fleet of packetized DERs with a group of homogeneous macromodels are analytically derived for relevant PEM information scenarios. Finally, simulation-based analysis validates the results and shows that PEM is suitable for providing load balancing and ramping services for the grid.

						This paper presents an algorithm for the identification of parameters for a stochastic hot water end-use process that drives a homogeneous population of thermostatically controlled electric water heaters (EWH). Usually, only metered interval consumption data (kWh) is collected and the hot water end-use process is unobservable to utility and aggregators. However, the availability of EWHs for demand response (DR) is closely coupled with the hot water end-use process. In this context, the hot water end-use process is modeled as a two-state Markov chain (Use / No use), which causes the thermostatic ON-OFF switching process to behave as a Markov renewal process (MRP). A set of first passage-time problems is developed to obtain the moments of the transition probability densities of the MRP. These problems are addressed by establishing a system of coupled partial differential equations characterizing the temperature evolution of the EWH population. A key quantity in the methodology for estimating the parameters is the total time an EWH is ON within a period of interest. It is referred to as the total busy time. Total busy time in this approach is a random variable for which analytical expressions of the moments are developed as a function of the metered window length. The latter expressions become the basis of a hot water demand model identification algorithm which is validated using agent-based simulations of EWHs.

						This paper presents a convex, multi-period, AC-feasible Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework that robustly dispatches flexible demand-side resources in unbalanced distribution feeders against uncertainty in very-short timescale solar Photo-Voltaic (PV) forecasts. This is valuable for power systems with significant behind-the-meter solar PV generation as their operation is affected by uncertainty from forecasts of demand and solar PV generation. The aim of this work is then to ensure the feasibility and reliability of distribution system operation under high solar PV penetration. We develop and present a novel, robust OPF formulation that accounts for both the nonlinear power flow constraints and the uncertainty in forecasts. This is achieved by linearizing an optimal trajectory and using first-order methods to systematically tighten voltage bounds. Case studies on a realistic distribution feeder shows the effectiveness of a receding-horizon implementation.

						High penetrations of intermittent renewable energy resources in the power system require large balancing reserves for reliable operations. Aggregated and coordinated behind-the-meter loads can provide these fast reserves, but represent energy-constrained and uncertain reserves (in their energy state and capacity). To optimally dispatch uncertain, energy-constrained reserves, optimization-based techniques allow one to develop an appropriate trade-off between closed-loop performance and robustness of the dispatch. Therefore, this paper investigates the uncertainty associated with energy-constrained aggregations of flexible, behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs). The uncertainty studied herein is associated with estimating the state of charge and the capacity of an aggregation of DERs (i.e., a virtual energy storage system or VESS). To that effect, a risk-based chance constrained control strategy is developed that optimizes the operational risk of unexpectedly saturating the VESS against deviating generators from their scheduled set-points. The controller coordinates energy-constrained VESSs to minimize unscheduled participation of and overcome ramp-rate limited generators for balancing variability from renewable generation, while taking into account grid conditions. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation-based analysis is carried out on an augmented IEEE RTS-96 network with uncertain energy resources and temperature-based dynamic line ratings.

						This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the multi-period optimal dispatch of deterministic inverter-interfaced energy storage in an unbalanced distribution feeder with significant solar PV penetration. The three-phase, non-convex loss-minimization problem is formulated as a convex second-order cone program (SOCP) for the dispatch of batteries in a receding-horizon fashion in order to counter against the variable, renewable generation. The solution of the SOCP is used to initialize a nonlinear program (NLP) in order to ensure a physically realizable solution. The phenomenon of simultaneous charging and discharging of batteries is rigorously analyzed and conditions are derived that guarantee it is avoided. Simulation scenarios are implemented with GridLab-D for the IEEE-13 and IEEE-123 node test feeders and illustrate not only AC feasibility of the solution, but also near-optimal performance and solve-times within a minute.

						Multi-energy systems (MES) offer an opportunity to leverage energy conversion processes and temporary energy storage mechanisms to reduce costs and emissions during operation of buildings, campuses, and cities. With increasing options for flexibility in demand-side resources, it is possible to temporarily defer thermal and electrical demand of (flexible) buildings without sacrificing comfort and convenience of its occupants, which can improve overall MES economic efficiency and reduce emissions.

						To that effect, this paper develops a linear optimization formulation of a MES with flexible (thermal and electric) building demands that capture nonlinearities in the efficiencies of energy conversion processes. The optimization formulation accounts for multiple time-steps to capture the (first-order) dynamics of large thermal building loads. The flexible buildings are parameterized, in part, based on historical data from a college campus in Vermont, USA. The idea of the MES model is to investigate the role that flexible building loads play in reducing costs and emissions for a small campus relative to that of a possible carbon tax. The operation of the MES is optimized to reduce costs based on representative seasons and carbon tax scenarios. Interestingly, it is found that when utilized optimally, flexible buildings can offer an effective method to improve economic efficiency while also reducing carbon emissions close to the levels that a carbon tax would realize, though without carbon price’s large cost increases. That is, we present evidence that flexible buildings in Vermont may offer another route to achieve the emission goals close to that of a carbon tax policy.

					<span id="cdc_pvb_2020" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						The goal of this paper is to develop a low-order model to represent the coordination of distributed energy resources based on concepts that make the internet work and is known as packetized energy management (PEM). The low-order model includes energy as a state variable together with dynamic opt-out constraints and internal packet request feedback, which in principle turns the model into a PEM virtual battery (PEM-VB) model. The paper focuses on a homogeneous aggregation of electric water heaters (EWHs) under PEM. It is shown that the bottom-up logic of the PEM-VB makes the system observable mainly due to the convenient feeding back of the number of packet requests through the communication channel es- tablished between the PEM coordinator and devices enrolled in the scheme. Without such extra information, the system loses the ability to observe the system’s stored energy state. A procedure for comput- ing the maximum and minimum energy bounds for the PEM-VB is developed. Moreover, the PEM-VB is explicitly used as the underly- ing model for an extended Kalman filter observer formulation with the purpose of estimating the energy stored in a simulated ensemble of agent-based EWHs under PEM. The use of PEM-VB is demon- strated in pre-positioning of flexible resources depending upon load forecasts. Finally, conclusions and future directions are provided.					</span>

						Distributed algorithms provide attractive features for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in interconnected power systems compared to traditional centralized algorithms. Distributed algorithms help to maintain the control autonomy and data privacy of subsystems, which is particularly relevant in competitive markets and practical control system implementations. This paper analyzes a distributed optimization algorithm known as the "Auxiliary Principle Problem" to solve multiperiod distributed DCOPF problems with energy storage systems. The proposed approach enables multiple interconnected systems with their own sub-objectives to share their resources and to participate in an electricity market without implicitly sharing information about their local generators or internal network parameters. The paper also shows how the proposed approach can enable future microgrids to coordinate their operation, reduce the total operational cost, and avoid internal constraint violations caused by unscheduled flows (USF) while maintaining the subsystems’ autonomy. We used an 11-bus test system consisting of two interconnected subsystems to evaluate the proposed approach and analyze the impact of USF.

					Load tap changers (LTCs) are commonly used for voltage control in distribution systems. The mechanical relays on LTCs are controlled in discrete steps; hence, distribution optimal power flow (DOPF) formulations require LTCs to be modeled with integer variables. Integer variables are generally ignored or relaxed and rounded off to reduce the computational burden in DOPF models. However, in this paper, we highlight and overcome complex infeasibility issues caused by rounding methods. Moreover, recent advances in convex optimization have improved the computational tractability of the DOPF problem. In this paper, we develop and analyze numerical efficiency of different but exact formulations for incorporating LTCs as integer control assets in a relaxed second-order cone program (SOCP) version of the DOPF model. The resulting formulation becomes a mixed-integer SOCP (MISOCP), which is computationally tractable compared to mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP). To recover the exact optimal solution in the proposed MISOCP-DOPF model, a McCormick relaxation is employed within a sequential bound-tightening algorithm. We show that solutions obtained from MISOCP-DOPF are always ac feasible. Thus, the MISOCP-DOPF yields optimal and realistic ac solutions, and is validated in large distribution feeders and is compared to MINLP counterpart.				</span>

						There is increasing consensus that flexible demand is critical to solve challenges associated with the rapid growth of variable renewable generation and aging transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure. Conventional direct load control programs are largely insufficient to address these issues. This paper presents results from validation tests of a new approach to demand side management, in which an aggregated fleet of devices is managed as a virtual battery, using principles that are found in communication networks: packetization and randomization. Validation results from a cyber-physical testbed with 5000 devices and a field-trial with 82 customer-owned water heaters show that the packetized virtual battery system can effectively solve a number of different problems. Customer satisfaction survey results illustrate that the system is able to maintain a high level of service quality.

						In this paper, we employ a bi-level control system to react to disturbances and balance power mismatch by coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) under packetized energy management. Packetized energy management (PEM) is a novel bottom-up asynchronous and randomizing coordination paradigm for DERs that guarantees quality of service, autonomy, and privacy to the end-user. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of a cyber-physical system consisting of PEM enabled DERs, flexible virtual power plants (VPPs) and transmission grid is developed in this work. A predictive, energy-constrained dispatch of aggregated PEM-enabled DERs is formulated, implemented, and validated on the HIL cyber-physical platform. The energy state of VPPs, composed of a fleet of diverse DERs distributed in the grid, depend upon the distinct real-time usage of these devices. The experimental results demonstrate that the existing control schemes, such as AGC, dispatch VPPs without regard to their energy state, which leads to unexpected capacity saturation. By accounting for the energy states of VPPs, model-predictive control (MPC) can optimally dispatch conventional generators and VPPs to overcome disturbances while avoiding undesired capacity saturation. The results show the improvement in dynamics by using MPC over conventional AGC and droop for a system with energy-constrained resources.

						This paper presents a method to obtain a convex inner approximation that aims to improve the feasibility of optimal power flow (OPF) models in distribution feeders. For a resistive distribution network, both real and reactive power effect the node voltages and this makes it necessary to consider both when formulating the OPF problem. Inaccuracy in linearized OPF models may lead to under and over voltages when dispatching flexible demand, at scale, in response to whole-sale market or grid conditions. In order to guarantee feasibility, this paper obtains an inner convex set in which the dispatchable resources can operate, based on their real and reactive power capabilities, that guarantees network voltages to be feasible.

				<span id="globalsip2018_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Solutions to optimal power flow (OPF) problems provide operating points for electric power systems that minimize operational costs while satisfying both engineering limits and the power flow equations. OPF problems are non-convex and may have multiple local optima. To search for global optima, recent research has developed a variety of convex relaxations to bound the optimal objective values of OPF problems. Certain relaxations, such as the quadratic convex (QC) relaxation, are derived from OPF representations that contain trilinear monomials. Previous work has considered three techniques for relaxing these trilinear monomials: <i>recursive McCormick</i> (RMC) envelopes, <i>Meyer and Floudas</i> (MF) envelopes, and <i>extreme-point</i> (EP) envelopes. This paper compares the tightness and computational speed of relaxations that employ each of these techniques. Forming the convex hull of a single trilinear monomial, MF and EP envelopes are equivalently tight. Empirical results show that QC formulations using MF and EP envelopes give tighter bounds than those using RMC envelopes. Empirical results also indicate that the EP envelopes have advantages over MF envelopes with respect to computational speed and numerical stability when used with state-of-the-art second-order cone programming solvers.

				<span id="empirical_nonconvexity2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a central problem in the operation of electric power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities, local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some problems appear to have convex or "nearly convex" feasible spaces in terms of the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes. Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible spaces, this paper first describes an empirical study that aims to characterize non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes several medium-size test cases that challenge a variety of solution algorithms.

					With growing penetrations of stochastic renewable generation and the need to accurately model the network physics, optimization problems that explicitly consider uncertainty and the AC power flow equations are becoming increasingly important to the operation of electric power systems. This paper describes initial steps towards an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) algorithm which yields an operating point that is guaranteed to be robust to all realizations of stochastic generation within a specified uncertainty set. Ensuring robust feasibility requires overcoming two challenges: 1) ensuring solvability of the power flow equations for all uncertainty realizations and 2) guaranteeing feasibility of the engineering constraints for all uncertainty realizations. This paper primarily focuses on the latter challenge. Specifically, this paper poses the robust AC OPF problem as a bi-level program that maximizes (or minimizes) the constraint values over the uncertainty set, where a convex relaxation of the AC power flow constraints is used to ensure conservativeness. The resulting optimization program is solved using an alternating solution algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated via detailed analyses of two small test cases.

					The power flow equations are at the heart of many optimization and control problems relevant to power systems. The non-linearity of these equations leads to computational challenges in solving power flow and optimal power flow problems (non-convergence, local optima, etc.). Accordingly, various linearization techniques, such as the DC power flow, are often used to approximate the power flow equations. In contrast to a wide variety of general linearization techniques in the power systems literature, this paper computes a linear approximation that is specific to a given power system and operating range of interest. An "adaptive linearization" developed using this approach minimizes the worst-case error between the output of the approximation and the actual non-linear power flow equations over the operating range of interest. To compute an adaptive linearization, this paper proposes a constraint generation algorithm that iterates between 1) using an optimization algorithm to identify a point that maximizes the error of the linearization at that iteration and 2) updating the linearization to minimize the worst-case error among all points identified thus far. This approach is tested on several IEEE test cases, with the results demonstrating up to a factor of four improvement in approximation error over linearizations based on a first-order Taylor approximation.

					AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recently developed convex relaxation techniques provide new insights regarding the global optimality of AC OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. This paper proposes two methods for tightening the QC relaxation. The first method introduces new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between connected buses. Using "bound tightening" techniques, the bounds on the voltage magnitude difference variables can be significantly smaller than the bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves, so constraints based on voltage magnitude differences can tighten the relaxation. Second, rather than a potentially weaker "nested McCormick" formulation, this paper applies "Meyer and Floudas" envelopes that yield the convex hull of the trilinear monomials formed by the product of the voltage magnitudes and trignometric terms in the polar form of the power flow equations. Comparison to a state-of-the-art QC implementation demonstrates the advantages of these improvements via smaller optimality gaps.

Another application of graph metrics is the characterization of computational behavior. We conclude by illustrating one compelling example: the close connection between clique analysis and semidefinite programming solver performance.

					Increasing communication and control capabilities will allow future power system operators to exploit large quantities of responsive demand. This paper discusses ongoing work that employs demand response to improve voltage stability via virtual spatial shifting of loads (i.e., altering the locational distribution of power consumption in one time period with an energy payback in a following time period). In this paper, we study the impact of load models on a previously proposed iterative linearization algorithm to determine loading patterns that maximize a voltage stability margin, namely, the smallest singular value (SSV) of the power flow Jacobian matrix. Specifically, we extend the algorithm to enable inclusion of composite load models consisting of both "ZIP" components and a steady-state squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) model. We then investigate the impact of different load models on both the stability margin and the loading pattern. Using the IEEE 14-bus system as an illustrative example, the results show that the  type of load model affects the nominal system's SSV, the optimal SSV, and the optimal loading pattern. The maximum-achievable percent change in SSV is larger using IM models than using ZIP models. We also discuss the difficulty in interpreting the stability margin when the system undergoes structural changes resulting from the use of different voltage-dependent load models.

					Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.

				<span id="powertech2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.

				<span id="cdc2016_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.

					The power flow equations, which relate power injections and voltage phasors, are at the heart of many electric power system computations. While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.

					The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gr&ouml;bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.

					Reliable power system operation requires maintaining sufficient voltage stability margins. Traditional techniques based on continuation and optimization calculate lower bounds for these margins and generally require appropriate initialization. Building on a previous semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation, this paper proposes a new second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation which directly yields upper bounds for the voltage stability margin without needing to specify an initialization. Augmentation with integer-constrained variables enables consideration of reactive-power-limited generators. Further, leveraging the ability to globally solve these problems, this paper describes a sufficient condition for insolvability of the power flow equations. Trade-offs between tightness and computational speed of the SDP and SOCP relaxations are studied using large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					A novel model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed for mitigating the effects of severe line-overload disturbances in electrical power systems. A piece-wise linear convex approximation of line losses is employed to model the effect of transmission line power flow on conductor temperatures. Control is achieved through a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) strategy which alleviates line temperature overloads and thereby prevents the propagation of outages. The MPC strategy adjusts line flows by rescheduling generation, energy storage and controllable load, while taking into account ramp-rate limits and network limitations. In Part II of this paper, the MPC strategy is illustrated through simulation of the IEEE RTS-96 network, augmented to incorporate energy storage and renewable generation.

					The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the operating cost of an electric power system. Applications of convex relaxation techniques to the non-convex OPF problem have been of recent interest, including work using the Lasserre hierarchy of "moment" relaxations to globally solve many OPF problems. By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize active power losses for portions of several European power systems. Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class of problems.

				<span id="naps2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Large-scale electric power system analysis depends upon representation of vast numbers of components whose individual models must be populated with parameters. The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.

					Recently, convex "moment" relaxations developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP), generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The resulting "mixed SDP/SOCP" formulation implements the first-order relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by factors from 1.13 to 18.7.

				<span id="iscas2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to  physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.

						Power system planning and operation offers multitudinous opportunities for optimization methods. In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data  infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.

					<span id="hicss2014_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Recently, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations has been applied to the optimal power flow problem. When this relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero duality gap), a globally optimal solution is obtained. Existing literature investigates sufficient conditions whose satisfaction guarantees zero duality gap solutions. However, there is limited study of non-zero duality gap solutions. By illustrating the feasible spaces for optimal power flow problems and their semidefinite relaxations, this paper investigates examples of nonzero duality gap solutions. Results for large system models suggest that non-convexities associated with small subsections of the network are responsible for non-zero duality gap solutions.

						Initializing internal variables in dynamic power system simulations is a two-stage process. First, a power flow model is used to find the steady state bus variables. Second, values for the internal variables associated with bus connected components are determined such that the components' terminal values match the bus variables calculated from the power flow model. Initializing most components' variables is a straightforward, direct process. However, initializing induction machine variables traditionally uses an indirect, iterative process. In this paper, eigenvalue formulations are detailed for both the induction machine initialization and power flow models, which provide a direct method for determining all possible sets of induction machine initializations and offer a novel model for the power flow equations.

						Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems.</br></br>

						This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method.</br></br>

						This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations.</br></br>

						Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions.</br></br>

						Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.

						The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex "optimal power flow" (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates a SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.

						The Electricity Modernization Act of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the creation of enforceable reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the “Bulk-Power System” (BPS). This paper introduces an algorithm based on electrical properties of an electric power network that yields a numeric ranking of its branch elements, as a step towards identifying which elements should be considered part of the BPS. This ranking depends solely on network topology and element electrical characteristics, and is wholly independent of generator cost functions and system operating point. Two perspectives for deriving and justifying this ranking algorithm are described: one based on the sensitivity of bus-to-branch Lagrange multipliers and another based on generation shift factors. Summary results obtained from applying the algorithm to a detailed model of the US Eastern Interconnection are reported (with suitable anonymity for any facility specific data, in keeping with Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) protections).
