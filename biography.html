<h1><font size="5">Biography</font></h1>

<p>
I am the L. Richard Fisher Associate Professor in the Department of
Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Vermont and was
co-founder of clean-tech startup, Packetized Energy, that commercialized
technology related to his research and was recently acquired by EnergyHub.
His research interests lie at the intersection of power/energy systems,
mathematical optimization, and control systems and focus on developing
scalable algorithms that improve responsiveness and resilience of energy
systems with a recent focus on advanced distribution system operations. He
currently serves as Executive Director of CREATE, Associate Editor at IEEE
Transactions on Power Systems, and Chair of the IEEE Control System Society
(CSS) Technical Committee on Energy Systems. His work has been highlighted
by IEEE Spectrum Magazine and Just Have a Think in 2022 and recognized with
a recent NSF CAREER award in 2021 and the Outstanding Junior Faculty award
in his college in 2016. He currently holds a joint appointment as Chief
Scientist in PNNL’s Optimization & Control Group and was Otto Mønsted
Visiting Professor at DTU Wind & Energy Systems (WES) in Denmark in
2021-22. Prior to joining the University of Vermont, he was Lead Systems
Engineer at another startup: Root3 Technologies in Chicago, IL. Before
that, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in Electrical
Engineering (EE): Systems in 2013 and a dual major in Electrical
Engineering and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio
in 2008. When he is not working on energy riddles or teaching, he spends
his time with his amazing wife and their three wonderful children.
