			<h1>Brief Biography</h1>

<p> I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Vermont. I am also co-founder of clean-tech startup Packetized Energy that is commercializing technology related to my research. My research interests lie at the intersection of power systems, mathematical optimization, and control systems and focus on developing scalable algorithms that improve responsiveness and resilience of energy and power systems with a recent focus on advanced distribution system operations. I am currently the Chair of the IEEE PES Smart Buildings, Loads, and Customer Systems (SBLC) technical subcommittee on Loads. My work has been recognized with a recent NSF CAREER award in 2021 and the Outstanding Junior Faculty award in CEMS in 2016. Prior to joining the University of Vermont, I was lead systems engineer at energy startup company Root3 Technologies in Chicago, IL. Before that, I received my PhD from the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering (EE): Systems in 2013 and a dual major in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio in 2008. When I am not working on energy problems or teaching, I spending my time with my amazing wife and our three wonderful children. </p>

			<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>In the CORE Systems Lab, our goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of how power and energy systems can actively and reliably respond to changing market and grid conditions and enable a clean energy future. Towards this objective, our group seeks to develop impactful grid-aware control and optimization algorithms that coordinate distributed, networked grid and energy resources. Our group's work, thus, investigates modeling and control of fleets of distributed energy resources (DERs) as virtual energy storage (VES), optimization of DERs in transmission and distribution systems, and real-time validation of algorithms in a practical context. </p>
