			<h1>Brief Biography</h1>

<p> 
Mads R&oslashnne Almassalkhi is the L. Richard Fisher Associate Professor in the
Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of
Vermont and is co-founder of clean-tech startup, Packetized Energy, that is
commercializing technology related to his research and was recently
acquired by EnergyHub. His research interests lie at the intersection of
power/energy systems, mathematical optimization, and control systems and
focus on developing scalable algorithms that improve responsiveness and
resilience of energy and power systems with a recent focus on advanced
distribution system operations. He currently serves as Associate Editor at
IEEE Transactions on Power Systems and was the previous Chair of the IEEE
PES Smart Buildings, Loads, and Customer Systems (SBLC) technical
subcommittee on Loads. His work has been highlighted by IEEE Spectrum
Magazine in 2022 and recognized with a recent NSF CAREER award in 2021 and
the Outstanding Junior Faculty award in his college in 2016.  He currently holds a
joint appointment as Chief Scientist in PNNL’s Optimization & Control
Group and was Otto Mønsted Visiting Professor at DTU Wind & Energy Systems (WES) in Denmark in 2021-22. 
Prior to joining the University of Vermont, he was Lead Systems
Engineer at another startup: Root3 Technologies in Chicago, IL.
Before that, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in
Electrical Engineering (EE): Systems in 2013 and a dual major in Electrical
Engineering and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio
in 2008. When he is not working on energy problems or teaching, he spends
his time with his amazing wife and their three wonderful children.

			<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>In the CORE Systems Lab, our goal is to advance our fundamental
understanding of how power and energy systems can actively and reliably
respond to changing market and grid conditions and enable the large-scale
integration of renewable energy. Towards this objective, our group seeks to
develop impactful grid-aware control and optimization algorithms that
coordinate distributed, networked grid and energy resources. Our group's
work, thus, investigates modeling and control of fleets of distributed
energy resources (DERs) as virtual energy storage (VES), optimization of
DERs in transmission and distribution systems, and realistic validation and field demonstration of
algorithms in a practically relevant context. </p>
